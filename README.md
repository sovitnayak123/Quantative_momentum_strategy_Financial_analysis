# Quantitative Momentum Strategy

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a quantitative momentum strategy for trading S&P 500 stocks. The strategy identifies stocks with the highest momentum and generates trade recommendations. This approach is based on the idea that stocks that have performed well in the past will continue to perform well in the future.

## Overview

The quantitative momentum strategy is a systematic trading strategy that leverages statistical and mathematical models to identify and trade stocks with strong momentum. This strategy focuses on:

- **Selecting Stocks:** Identifying S&P 500 stocks with the highest momentum based on historical performance.
- **Generating Signals:** Creating buy and sell signals based on momentum indicators.
- **Backtesting:** Evaluating the performance of the strategy using historical data.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantitative-momentum-strategy.git
   cd quantitative-momentum-strategy
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook quantitative_momentum_strategy.ipynb
   ```

3. **Follow the steps in the notebook to execute the strategy:**
   - **Data Loading:** Load the list of S&P 500 stocks and historical price data.
   - **Calculating Momentum:** Compute momentum indicators such as relative strength index (RSI) and moving average convergence divergence (MACD).
   - **Generating Signals:** Create buy and sell signals based on the calculated indicators.
   - **Backtesting:** Evaluate the strategy's performance using historical data.
